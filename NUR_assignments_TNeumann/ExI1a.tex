\section{Exercise 1: Poisson distribution}

In this exercise the poisson probability distribution for integer k should be calculated with the given values.

The poisson probability distribution is given as:

\begin{equation}
	P_{\lambda}(k) = \frac{\lambda ^k exp(-\lambda)}{k!}
\end{equation}

While calculations a straight-forward derivation with 32-bit values would run into overflow-problems for the k-factorial, the given equation was converted into log-space which gives the following equation:
 
The result is calculated the following way:
\begin{equation}
	log(P_{\lambda}(k)) = log(\lambda ) *k - \lambda - \sum(k)
\end{equation}

The $P_{\lambda}(k)$ for the given values are calculated for 32-bit and 64-bit values with into log-space converted equation and as comparison the same is derived using \textit{scipy} via the given equation.
