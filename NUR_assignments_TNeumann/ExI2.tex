\section{Exercise 2: Vandemonde matrix}

The Vandermonde-matrix can be obtained to find an unique solution for a given  Langrangian polynomial .
The coefficients of the Langrangian polynomial are calculated as:

\begin{equation}
	y_i = \sum{j=0}{N-1} g_j x_i^j
\end{equation}

\subsection{2.a) Approximation with LU-decomposition}

The entries of the Vandermonde-matrix ($V_{ij} = x_i^j$) are given and can read in by the following script:
 
\lstinputlisting{vandermonde.py}

With the code the following result for \textbf{c} is obtained.
