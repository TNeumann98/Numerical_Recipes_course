\section{Exercise 2: Vandemonde matrix}

In this exercise the poisson probability distribution for integer k should be calculated with the given values.

The poisson probability distribution is given as:

\begin{equation}
	y_i = \sum{j=0}{N-1} g_j x_i^j
\end{equation}

While calculations a straight-forward derivation with 32-bit values would run into overflow-problems for the k-factorial, the given equation was converted into log-space which gives the following equation:
 
The result is calculated the following way:
\begin{equation}
	log(P_{\lambda}(k)) = \lambda *k - \lambda - \sum(k)
\end{equation}

The entries of the Vandermonde-matrix ($V_{ij} = x_i^j$) are given and can read in by the following script:

The distribution of the data points is vizualized in the plot above.
