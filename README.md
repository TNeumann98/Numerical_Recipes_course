# NUR Assignment I
### 09.03.2023
### Tina Neumann

These are my hand-in solutions for the first assignemnt of NUR.

All my solved exercises have a .py-file with the code and a .tex-file for the user output.

Run.sh should run all the files automatically and give the required output.


Missing/ ToDO:
Ex 1): - last values evaluated with scipy has OverflowError (output = NaN)

Ex 2): - LU-decomposition does not work as expected:
Crout's algo (not-extended used)
--> no error for LU-decomposition
- delta_y plotting (wrong index selected) --> solved with .argmin()
